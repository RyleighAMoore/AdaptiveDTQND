From Akil:

- Look into cProfile to see where the time is going 

- Don't checkin __pycache__ files (they're in your gitignore. why are they
  checked in?) (Fixed)

- Also don't check in desktop.ini, and unless there's a good reason you
  probably shouldn't check in pickle files, either. (Removed .ini, pickeled files are used for error checking)

- LejaQuadrature.py/MeshUpdates.py
  - sys.path updating is not done in a cross-platform way. Use either os.path
    or pathlib. This also applies to other places.

- 2DTQ-UnorderedMeshWithMeshUpdates.py
  - profiling suggests that G, f1, and f2 gake a large chunk of time, and are
    called ~400,000 times for 5 timesteps. This seems unnecessary. They
    probably need to be vectorized.
  - there are also a lot of functions that seem to be called around 1e4 or 1e5
    times for this one simulation. Unless they're really low-level routines, I
    think things are probably implemented in suboptimal ways that take a lot of
    time by calling these functions many orders of magnitude more than
    necessary.
  - other things that seem to take a while are the
    continue_pivoted_lu_factorization and findNearestKPoints routines, but
    updating these is probably harder.

- DTQTensorized.py
  - generateGRow is too slow. From cProfile you can see that most of the time
    is spent in G, f1, f2 in Functions.py. This is because these are called in
    non-vectorized ways. 
  - in generateGRow you should also allocate row as a np array of the
    appropriate size rather than repeatedly appending to a list and then
    converting at the end.
  - in Functions.py, I would prefer if it if you coded this for generate
    multi-D scenarios. It's hard coded for 2D right now. (And it looks like has
    a tensor-product form.
